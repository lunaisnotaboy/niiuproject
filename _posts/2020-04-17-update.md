Niiverse is not going to be up for awhile. I am the sole person who has access to the server that it will be hosted on, and I will not be able to do it for some time.

As such, Niiverse is unofficially on hold for the time being.

If you are wondering why I can't work on it for awhile, it's because of some personal things that have been going on in my life. And yes, it has to do with me being a closeted trans.

I wish everyone the best of luck.
